# EC4219: Software Engineering (소프트웨어공학)
- Instructor: [Sunbeom So](https://gist-pal.github.io)
- Location: EECS B203
- Time: Mon/Wed 13:00-14:30

## About The Course
Software Engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of SW production process.
In particular, SW validation is highly important in the SW process due to the prevalence of SW errors, comprising more than half of the SW development cost.
Our focus in this course is to study program analysis methods, which are fundamental and modern technologies that can effectively help the SW validation process.
